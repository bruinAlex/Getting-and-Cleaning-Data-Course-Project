#CodeBook â€” UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (Tidy)

After executing the run_analysis.R script, the output tidy data set includes the following 88 variables below.

######Note: This code book only applies to the output from the run_analysis.R script, and is not necessarily applicable to the raw data

###Units Used
Data captured from the sensor signals are filtered per the UCI data set 'features_info.txt' and are denoted in acceleration and angular velocity.

###Summary Methods
The final tidy data set takes the mean of the variables listed below per the course project instructions.
